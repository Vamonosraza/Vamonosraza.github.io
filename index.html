                My apps are meant to be used by anyone who wants to use them. They are not violent or harmful in anyway. A lot of what I learn I learned from someone else so I give complete credit to them. 
            </p>
            
            <p>You may be here because you may have used one of my apps or came across my repo. If you have any questions or need support, feel free to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:martinezjessy393@gmail.com">martinezjessy393@gmail.com</a>.</p>
