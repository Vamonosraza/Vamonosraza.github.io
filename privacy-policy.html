    <h1>Privacy Policy for MaskMagic2</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: June 15, 2023</p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        MaskMagic2 is designed to respect your privacy. We collect minimal information required for the app to function:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Images:</strong> When you upload or create images for editing in the app, these images are processed locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> For diagnostic purposes only, we may collect basic information about your device (model, iOS version) to help troubleshoot issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        We use the information we collect to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Process your images for AI-based editing and generation</li>
        <li>Diagnose technical issues with the app</li>
        <li>Improve the app's performance and user experience</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>External Services</h2>
    <p>
        MaskMagic2 uses the following third-party services:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenAI API:</strong> When you use the image generation feature, your processed images and text prompts are sent to OpenAI's servers via a secure Google Cloud Function. This is necessary to generate AI-powered image edits.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Cloud Functions:</strong> We use Google Cloud Functions as a secure intermediary to process your requests to the OpenAI API. This protects our API credentials and enhances security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Transfer</h2>
    <p>
        Your data is shared only with the third-party services mentioned above, solely for the purpose of providing the app's functionality. We do not sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal information with other third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        Images and prompts sent to OpenAI are subject to their data retention policies. Please refer to <a href="https://openai.com/privacy/">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a> for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any data stored locally on your device remains there until you delete the app or clear its data.
    </p>
